# 🍪 Cookie Jar (Python OOP Project)

A simple Python class that models Cookie Monster’s cookie jar from **Sesame Street**.  
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, along with unit testing using **pytest**.

## 📖 Features
- Initialize a cookie jar with a maximum **capacity**
- Deposit cookies into the jar
- Withdraw cookies from the jar
- Prevents exceeding capacity or withdrawing too many cookies
- Returns a fun string representation (`🍪🍪🍪`) of the cookies inside
- Includes unit tests (`pytest`) for reliability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OOP principles (constructors, methods, properties)
- Error handling with `ValueError`
- Testing with **pytest**
